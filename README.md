# RLWE based distributed Key Generation and Threshold Decryption

This is a repository created to store all relevant codes deriving from the Master's Degree Thesis "RLWE based distributed Key Generation and Threshold Decryption" by Ferran Alborch Escobar and supervised by Ramiro Martínez Pinilla and Paz Morillo Bosch made within the Master in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering in the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.

We will go through what each main simulation, how to use it and any perks or problems it may have.

## Protocol simulation (decryption_sim.c, functions.c, functions.h, keygen_sim.c)
